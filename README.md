# Class-Imbalance-in-Streaming-Data
Testing Ensemble Methods in Class Imbalance Problems with Simulated Streaming Data

Data Source:
UCI Repository

Using the static data from UCI Repository to simualte streaming data, and test combinations of ensemble systems on their 
performance with class imblance data.

Ensemble systems: E; /n
Dimension Reduction methods: R = (SVM);
Sampling methods: S = (Oversampling on minority data, Undersampling on majority data, SMOTE);
Classification Algorithms: A = {SVM, Random Forest};

E = {R, S, A}
